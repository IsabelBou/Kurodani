This project intends to improve visualization and sorting of mobile game Touhou Lostword's storycard information, which has a dedicated  gamepress page.
The project consists of a back-end program that scrapes the previously mentioned gamepress page with jQuery and uses RegEx to parse  its HTML into useful information in the shape of a SQL database, which will be used by the front-end to display or filter this data in a more convenient manner.
